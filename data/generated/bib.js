        "abstract": "Visual Feature Learning (VFL) is a critical area of research in computer vision that involves the automatic extraction of features and patterns from images and videos. The applications of VFL are vast, including object detection and recognition, facial recognition, scene understanding, medical image analysis, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose to conduct extensive systematic literature review (SLR) on VFL based on deep learning algorithms. The paper conducted an SLR covering deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) including their variants. The review highlights the importance of VFL in computer vision and the limitations of traditional feature extraction techniques. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various deep learning algorithms for solving problems in VFL. The discussion of the applications of VFL provides an insight into the impact of VFL on various industries and domains. The review also analyzed the challenges faced by VFL, such as data scarcity and quality, overfitting, generalization, interpretability, and explainability. The discussion of future directions for VFL includes hybrid techniques, unsupervised feature learning, continual learning, attention-based models, and explainable AI. These techniques aim to address the challenges faced by VFL and improve the performance of the models. The systematic literature review concludes that VFL is a rapidly evolving field with the potential to transform many industries and domains. The review highlights the need for further research in VFL and emphasizes the importance of responsible use of VFL models in various applications. The review provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision, who can use these insights to enhance their work and ensure the responsible use of VFL models.",

The study was based on the retrospective data of 191 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and compared the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models with and without image fusion. The results showed that the fusion model had higher consistency with manual labeling in quantifying scar load and myocardial volume, and could effectively segment more image sections (95% vs. 89%, P < 0.001). Correlation coefficient analysis indicates that the fusion model is superior to the single modal model in both scar and myocardial volume assessment. Therefore, Lage-Cine image fusion can significantly improve the effect of automatic scar quantification and has good potential for clinical application.",

Two segmentation protocols (Protocol 1 and Protocol 2) were investigated, the latter limiting the scar-segmentation search area to the left ventricular myocardial tissue region. CMR-LGE from 30 patients with ischemic-heart disease were retrospectively analyzed, for a total of 250 images, presenting high variability in terms of scar dimension and location. Segmentation results were assessed against manual scar-tissue tracing using one-patient-out cross validation.Protocol 2 outperformed Protocol 1 significantly (p value < 0.05), with median sensitivity and Dice similarity coefficient equal to 88.07% [inter-quartile range (IQR) 18.84%] and 71.25% (IQR 31.82%), respectively.Both segmentation protocols were able to detect scar tissues in the CMR-LGE images but higher performance was achieved when limiting the search area to the myocardial region. The findings of this paper represent an encouraging starting point for the use of FCNNs for the segmentation of nonviable scar tissue from CMR-LGE images.",

        "abstract": "Visualizing fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with contrast enhancement (late gadolinium enhancement; LGE) is paramount in characterizing disease progression and identifying arrhythmia substrates. Segmentation and fibrosis quantification from LGE-CMR is intensive, manual, and prone to interobserver variability. There is an unmet need for automated LGE-CMR image segmentation that ensures anatomical accuracy and seamless extraction of clinical features.This study aimed to develop a novel deep learning solution for analysis of contrast-enhanced CMR images that produces anatomically accurate myocardium and scar/fibrosis segmentations and uses these to calculate features of clinical interest.Data sources were 155 2-dimensional LGE-CMR patient scans (1124 slices) and 246 synthetic \u201cLGE-like\u201d scans (1360 slices) obtained from cine CMR using a novel style-transfer algorithm. We trained and tested a 3-stage neural network that identified the left ventricle (LV) region of interest (ROI), segmented ROI into viable myocardium and regions of enhancement, and postprocessed the segmentation results to enforce conforming to anatomical constraints. The segmentations were used to directly compute clinical features, such as LV volume and scar burden.Predicted LV and scar segmentations achieved 96% and 75% balanced accuracy, respectively, and 0.93 and 0.57 Dice coefficient when compared to trained expert segmentations. The mean scar burden difference between manual and predicted segmentations was 2%.We developed and validated a deep neural network for automatic, anatomically accurate expert-level LGE- CMR myocardium and scar/fibrosis segmentation, allowing direct calculation of clinical measures. Given the training set heterogeneity, our approach could be extended to multiple imaging modalities and patient pathologies.",

Late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been successful in guiding the clinical diagnosis and treatment reliably. For LGE CMR, many methods have demonstrated success in accurately segmenting scarring regions. Co-registration with other non-contrast-agent (non-CA) modalities [e.g., balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] can further enhance the efficacy of automated segmentation of cardiac anatomies. Many conventional methods have been proposed to provide automated or semi-automated segmentation of scars. With the development of deep learning in recent years, we can also see more advanced methods that are more efficient in providing more accurate segmentations.

        "abstract": "Accurate three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of myocardial replacement fibrosis (i.e., scar) is emerging as a potentially valuable tool for risk stratification and procedural planning in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The main purpose of this study was to develop a semiautomated method using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based for the segmentation of left ventricle (LV) myocardial scar from 3D late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance (LGE-MR) images.Our proposed CNN is built upon several convolutional and pooling layers aimed at choosing appropriate features from LGE-MR images to distinguish between myocardial scar and healthy tissues of the left ventricle. In contrast to previous methods that consider image intensity as the sole feature, CNN-based algorithms have the potential to improve the accuracy of scar segmentation through the creation of unconventional features that separate scar from normal myocardium in the feature space. The first step of our pipeline was to manually delineate the left ventricular myocardium, which was used as the region of interest for scar segmentation. Our developed algorithm was trained using 265,220 volume patches extracted from ten 3D LGE-MR images, then was validated on 450,454 patches from a testing dataset of 24 3D LGE-MR images, all obtained from patients with chronic myocardial infarction. We evaluated our method in the context of several alternative methods by comparing algorithm-generated segmentations to manual delineations performed by experts.Our CNN-based method reported an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Jaccard Index (JI) of 93.63% \u00b1 2.6% and 88.13% \u00b1 4.70%. In comparison to several previous methods, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), hierarchical max flow (HMF), full width at half maximum (FWHM), and signal threshold to reference mean (STRM), the developed algorithm reported significantly higher accuracy for DSC with a P-value less than 0.0001.Our experimental results demonstrated that our CNN-based proposed method yielded the highest accuracy of all contemporary LV myocardial scar segmentation methodologies, inclusive of the most widely used signal intensity-based methods, such as FWHM and STRM. To our knowledge, this is the first description of LV myocardial scar tissue segmentation from 3D LGE-MR images using a CNN-based method.",
